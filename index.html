                        Tic tac toe reminds me of those innocent days where school recess meant a small scribbles of knots and crosses(as we called it then) with friends. This memory inspired me to build the project using HTML canvas and another version in jQuery as a battle setting between Yoda and Darth Vader.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was a fun experience working on the same project twice but each done differently. One reminds of my childhood and the other made me become a child once again with the sound effects and the winner’s mime. They also taught me that the only limitation is one’s imagination.

                    <p>
                        The project was built using HTML5 Canvas, jQuery, CSS

                        My love for food and cooking inspired me to build this recipe search site, where a user could search recipes based on the ingredients and the diet type. If the user is logged in, there is an option for saving the recipes as favorites for future reference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Searching for a recipe API that worked was the sour bit in this project and my future changes to the project would be to make the user add his/her recipes and a comment/review module.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The poject was built using Rails4, Postgres as the database, Bootstrap for the designing and edaman API for the recipes.

                        This group project was inspired from "Drawful" by Jackful games and was designed for 3-8 players, each competing on separate web browsers.The project was quite ambitious given a week's duration but was fun and a great team effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game features free hand drawing onto a blank space, made possible through HTML5's Canvas API with help from the Paper.js library. In order to achieve a real-time drawing effect across all clients, websockets were used for client/server communication. While the 'drawer' interacted with the games canvas, graphical data was sent through our Ruby on Rails backend and emitted to all participating players. This was all tied together using a single-page Backbone application to give the user a pleasant gaming experience. </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we are aware of the problems that can still be resolved and have come up with the following improvements: - Optimise Backbone.js views - Support multiple games running simultaneously - Offer a flexible colour palette - Anti-aliasing on canvas paths.

                        Any one planning for an event, from a simple birthday party or a meeting to a large scale wedding, would know how tough and difficult it is to get it organised. PlanEasy is a web application that helps users organise important personal gatherings for special occasions, including parties, graduations and other friend and family focused celebrations. With PlanEasy a user can create an event, manage its guest list, send invites and receive the RSVP status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scope of the project is huge and only a part of it was focused hence my future enhancements to this project would include sending personalised invites other than plain text messages, an event planning to do’s tracker, Geo-location related hints

                    <p>
                        The project was built using Rails4, Mandrill, Bootstrap, and jQuery
